# Intro

Gamlang is an intermediate language aimed towards the osdev community.
This aims to make use of the useful, but mostly unknown opcodes in 386 systems.
It is aimed to make osdev much easier with a variety of highly optimised functions for adding to the GDT, IDT, and IVT.
There also will be built in functions to switch from protected mode to real mode.
